It was certainly very flattering to [2] me to see the work approved of by you; so much the more as I really stood in need of some consolation. I have been already violently attacked on account of that very book, and in such terms too, with such arms, as a gentleman would hardly think proper to employ. Now I must expect that a great-many Criticks will treat my poor <hi rend="weight:bold">essay</hi> and itʼs unfortunate author in a mercyless manner, and it is but natural that I should wish to be supported by those who are known both as competent judges and as men of honour. It would have been quite the contrary of discretion to request you publickly to express your opinion of the work before I knew whether that opinion was really favourable – but now I really whish the interest you have ever been kind enough to take in my fate, may prove sufficiently powerful to counterbalance the claims which science has upon your time, and to induce you to turn for one moment from your more serious occupations to the litterary debates of the day – and a litterary gazette. Begging you will do me the honour of writing yourself a few lines in behalf of my work, I cannot but add that I am fully sensible of the many obligations I owe you already, and thank you for what you have so kindly done to make the esquisse known in France. – You advise me to dispatch some copies of it to <placeName key="171">Paris</placeName>, and to send them for that purpose under <persName key="2309">the Duke <hi rend="weight:bold">de Broglieʼs</hi></persName> direction, to the french embassy. I would have gladly followed your advice, had [3] it not been for several difficulties. In the first instance <persName key="2598">Mr. Bresson the french Minister</persName>, and <persName key="2597">Mr. de Ribeaupierre</persName> have long lived on very bad terms, and ever since there has been very little intercourse between the french embassy, and the Russians that are living in this place, including me. Besides the Duke himself has been obliged by a very illjudged opposition to withdraw from the administration. – I really wish therefore that some other means may offer, of having the book conveyed to <placeName key="171">Paris</placeName>.<lb/>But enough – too much perhaps of that. I dare not enquire about your own occupations, for fear whatever you could say about them would be thrown-away on a profane being. India, itʼs litterature and history are things which I not only know very little about, but the study of which I have always been rather afraid of entering into at all, beeause I knew it to be very enticing and almost immeasurably extensive.<lb/>I see by your letter that a widowed niece is living with you; this Lady I suppose to be <persName key="121">Mme de Butlar</persName>, to whom I had the honour of being introduced at your house. Should I be right in this guess of mine, I beg you will kindly remember me to her. – <persName key="2566">Mr. Lassen</persName> I used to know well at <placeName key="574">Heydelberg</placeName>; I once had the misfortune of wounding him at the <hi rend="weight:bold">salle dʼarmes</hi> – though he was by far the fetter swordsman of the two – but I hope he has forgiven and forgot it.<lb/>[4] My own projects as well as prospects are as yet very uncertain; possibly I may go to <placeName key="540">St. Petersburg</placeName> within a few weeks; I am this moment expecting the directions of my friends. But whatever may happen, I still hope some favourable chance may bring me again to the banks of the Rhine – and in that case I should not fail to intrude upon your hospitality. In the mean time I beg you will believe that I ever am with the highest possible regard, most devotedly<lb/>Yourʼs<lb/>Th.[eodor] Knorring.<lb/><placeName key="15">Berlin</placeName> 20<hi rend="offset:4">th</hi> April. 1834.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
