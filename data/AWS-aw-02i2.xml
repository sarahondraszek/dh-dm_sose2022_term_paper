I am but a poor hand at writing French, although I can manage to read it – and I therefore write in my own language. I am much obliged and flattered by the tenor of your kind and instructive letter of 10 April.

To the Literati on the Continent I am still more indebted – and feel myself highly gratified and honored by the extreme courtesy and kindness of all that I have had the good fortune to meet – as well as by their occasional flattering mention of my writings: not to omit the high honor of having my name enrolled among t<milestone unit="start" n="41979"/>[he]</hi><note type="Notiz_zur_Transkription"><title>Textverlust durch Siegelwachs</title></note><milestone unit="end" n="41979"/><hi rend="family:Courier"> illustrious names of <orgName key="6179"><orgName key="8914">some Literary Societies</orgName></orgName>.<lb/>When you revisit England I hope I may have the pleasure of being presented to you.

You can breakfast there and dine at <placeName key="6395">Bealings</placeName>.<lb/>You notice having commenced the formation of an Indian Museum.

Such things you say are rare and difficult to be met with on the continent. Such a collection as mine, of metallic casts especially, could not be made except by the accumulation of many years. But a few casts and pictures are now and then offered for sale in <placeName key="292">London</placeName>. They are rather expensive. I was many years making my Collection – some of them years of tumult, anarchy, war, invasion, famine &amp;c – when even temples were not spared – in the Countries of the Mahrattas. I had been much at <placeName key="6397">Poona</placeName>, and over those Countries, and had opportunities from extensive acquaintance and official communication with natives, to make my wishes known as to such things – many more brought to me, and I purchased them as a considerable expence.

My fellow travellers and I remarked a peculiar air of gentility about the Inhabitants of <placeName key="887">Bonn</placeName>. We approached it on a Sunday – and met and saw more respectably dressed people than we ever saw in or about any town or city on a journey of some thousands of miles. You will very properly smile at our John Bullism – but we did certainly remark that the approach to Bonn had more the appearance of that to one of our first rate towns (<placeName key="3530">Oxford</placeName> for instance) than any we saw in all our journeyings. We meant this, you are aware, as a compliment. I know not if you Bonnians will so take it. </hi><hi rend="family:Courier" rendition="#PRSPreset1">I</hi><hi rend="family:Courier"> must not omit to account and apologize for not having earlier thanked you for your letter now under acknowledgement.

My letters, it is true, may be written any where – but the occupation of travelling, visiting &amp;c. renders one indisposed to write. In the cause of our journey I met at <placeName key="6400">Cheltenham</placeName> our worthy friend <persName key="2619">Sir John Malcolm</persName>. He was quite well. The papers announce his appointment to Governor of <placeName key="2695">Madras</placeName> – a situation which will be highly gratifying to him. He and I went to India about the same time – (Cadets of 1781) – and we have been long acquainted.
